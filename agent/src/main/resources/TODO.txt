//TODO general list

- A fixed actuator able to capture thoughts. Act adds a mental state which is returned as a sense
- Exception nodes optimization to prevent creating so many neurons
- Balance rules and infers for learning
- Decide about AND nodes or if Infer should balance the resistance in case one side is locked
- On UI selection, use up and down arrows to switch selected items
- Receptor nodes should use connotation instead of their own links
- Implement connotation node value, currently doesn't do anything
- Add tests over scenarios
- consider separating the resistance in complex infer
- Short term memory
- Backwards binding, maybe with Any and All
- Write tests

// Towers
- want tower1 empty should work
- Find the largest disk not on T3
- Work when starting from any valid state
- learn the rules


// MAYBE
- add AND node
- Rules can pull themselves up instead of getting it from other infers. Makes for a "theory"
- Balancing scenario, mark infer(rel(P3,isThe,Answer),rel(P3,isThe,Question)) as sense negative and then positive. Takes a long time.
    this is because of loop prevention and decay, so somewhat expected. Maybe something better than be done
